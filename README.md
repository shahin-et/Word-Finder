# Word-Finder
Generate words with the user's entered letters

Currently, added 3 languages. (Persian, English and Arabic).

There are multiple words files in Resources folder which are separated with '+' char.

User enter letters and the application generates all available meaningful words based on that letters and save them on selected directory.

I tested this application on PC and Android, but I think it works on other platforms too.

I use Unity3d for this project :).
